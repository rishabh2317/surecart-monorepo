    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
      To be eligible to create an account and use the Platform, you must be at
      least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding
      contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. If you are registering on
      behalf of a business entity, you represent that you have the authority to

    <strong>4.3 Partner Verification Process</strong>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
      The operational model of Mystash aims for a low-friction onboarding
      experience for its users. While the platform does not mandate the
      submission of government-issued identity documents for basic account
      registration and browsing (a process commonly known as "Know Your
      Customer" or KYC), it is imperative to establish a secure and compliant
      environment for financial transactions. The requirement to deduct Tax at
      Source (TDS) on commission payments necessitates the collection of a valid
      Permanent Account Number (PAN), which is a form of identity verification.
    </span>
    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>23</span>
    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
      {" "}
      Furthermore, guidelines for payment aggregators, which indirectly impact
      platforms like Mystash, often require verification of merchants to prevent
      fraud and money laundering.

    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>25</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>

    <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
